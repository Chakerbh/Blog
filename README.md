#Blog
This is a simple blog engine, I created it in order to learn [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) with ruby on rails.
You can check it on my blog @ [blog.chaker.tn](https://blog.chaker.tn).
Feel free to fork. If you have any questions, you can contact me via mail:** mail at chaker dot tn**, or via twitter [@chaker.benhamed](https://twitter.com/ChakerBenhamed).
